# python-api-challenge
Homework 6 for the python api module of Datavis bootcamp

Within the challenge notebooks folder, files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb contain the main scripts to run the analyses as well as the observations, inferences, scatter plots, linear regressions and maps.

My output data folder contains the CSV file I used, cities.csv - my script paths to this file. In addition, this folder contains files for figures 1 through 4 which contain scatter plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude.

The OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify API Keys are located in the api_keys.py folder and a gitignore file has been added to prevent the api keys from being shared with the public.
